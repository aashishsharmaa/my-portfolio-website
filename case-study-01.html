            <h4>Issues in development</h4>
            <h2>The curious case of an 'Unbreakable Pin'</h2>
          </article>

          <article class="section-center"> 
            <p>I took over the designs made by the previous designer on the team. These were similar to the designs done by the Hotels team and used a cluster pin behavior. When a user would tap on a cluster pin, it would break down into multiple pins at a zoomed-in level. 
            </p>
            <p>The cluster pin was a component within the company-wide design system, Universal Design System (UDS).
            </p>
          </article>

          <div class="section-left">
            <img src="images/Finding-Nearby-Activities/07-1-Pin-behaviour.png">
            <p class="small">Cluster pin broke down to multiple pins at a zoomed-in level.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="section-right">
            <img src="images/Finding-Nearby-Activities/07-2-Unbreakable-Pin.png">
            <p class="small">When real data was used, some pins did not break further.</p>
          </div>

          
          <article class="section-center">
            <p class="space"></p>
            <div class="highlight highlight-first">
              <p>Use of real data to populate the map pins resulted in two problems:
              </p>
              <ol class="number-items">
                <li>There were a lot of zoom issues.</li>
                <li>Some cluster pins wouldn't break further.</li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>While developers focused on the first problem, I focused on handling the unbreakable pin.
            </p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p class="thick">Why won't the pin break?</p>
            <p>Data showed that nearly 35% of pins did not break further. It happened because a single supplier could supply multiple activities from a single location.
            </p>
            <p>Hotels team did not face this issue as there is only one hotel at a location. It was not the case with activities.
            </p>


            <p class="space"></p>
            <p class="thick">How did I solve it?</p>
            <p>I sketched out, and then detailed, a few possible options: 
            </p>
            <ol class="number-items">
              <li>A bottom sheet with 1-2 cards, which scrolls over the map as a list view with other cards.</li>
              <li>Bottom sheet for pins with single activity, and a carousel for pins with multiple activities.</li>
              <li>A horizontal carousel for all kinds of pins.</li>
              <li>A carousel with an option to see as a list.</li>
            </ol>

          </div>

          <article class="section-center"> 
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>Since this was close to launch, we agreed to use (#3) a horizontal carousel for all pins, as it was available in the design system, and could be readily used by developers. Other options were not in the design system and needed more development time. 
            </p><p class="space"></p>
            <img src="images/Finding-Nearby-Activities/09-Solution-Carousel.png">
            <p class="small">Horizontal carousel was available in the design system, and could be readily used by developers.</p>
            <p class="space"></p>
            <p>Interestingly, post launch analytics showed that most users did not go past 3 cards, and in a user study done by the UXR team, users requested to see a list view after first few cards. So option (#4) was what users needed.
